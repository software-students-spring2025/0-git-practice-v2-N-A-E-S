## Summary && Why I choose it
This handy book emphasizes that clean code is not only for machines to understand but also for developers in a team to read and maintain. Underscores that writing clean code is not just a skill but also a professional ethic.
It uses real-world examples to illustrate how unclear code can lead to errors and high maintenance costs, also it provides simple rules, such as functions should be short and have a single responsibility, and names should clearly describe their purpose.
